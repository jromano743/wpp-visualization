# Wpp Visualization

The project consists of a notebook that reads a WhatsApp chat, sorts it into tables and generates graphs of interest to the user.

Some functions that can be found are:
- Most used emojis
- User(s) who speaks the most
- Frequency of messages by time of day
- chat wordcloud
- Chat Wordcloud (Valentine's Day)

The notebook will read the chat (txt or zip) that is placed in the Input folder. After the first 6 cells (configurations) each cell contains some graph of interest.

The files will be saved in a **"generated"** folder separated by the txt or zip name which was provided as input
